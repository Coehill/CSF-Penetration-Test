Challenge: 
Level 1: Display a popup using: <script>alert("XSS")</script>

Attack:
1) Navigate to /bodgeit/search.jsp
2) Inject <script>alert("XSS")</script> into the text box and press the "search" button
3) A popup will be generated with the text "XSS"

Vulnerability:
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in search form - insecure handling of untrusted data

Solution:
Implement input sanitisation on search form by setting search criteria on untrusted data.
This may be done by only accepting approved characters such as alphanumeric characters, 
which is a whitelist.  It may also be done by rejecting unapproved characters such as 
special characters (<>/\'...) in the form of a blacklist.
