Challenge: 
Level 2: Display a popup using: <script>alert("XSS")</script>

Attack:
1) Navigate to /bodgeit/register.jsp and enter john@doe.com<script>alert("XSS")</script> into the
   form.  Press submit.
3) Since the email is displayed at the top-right corner of the page once you are logged in, the 
   XSS script will also be run and so a popup with the text "XSS" appears

Vulnerability:
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in search form - insecure handling of untrusted data

Solution:
Implement input sanitisation on search form by setting search criteria on untrusted data.
This may be done by only accepting approved characters such as alphanumeric characters, 
which is a whitelist.  It may also be done by rejecting unapproved characters such as 
special characters (<>/\'...) in the form of a blacklist.
