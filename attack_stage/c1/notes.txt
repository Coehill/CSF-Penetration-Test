Challenge: 
Login as test@thebodgeitstore.com

Attack:
1) Navigate to /bodgeit/login.jsp and input the username "test@thebodgeitstore.com"
2) Input the password "password" and click the "Login" button.

Vulnerability:
Insecure authentication, since "password" is one of the most commonly used passwords

Solution:
Enforce a secure password policy, mandating users to choose a password which has a mix of upper and
lower cases, contains numbers and/or special characters, and is at least 8-characters long.  
For additional security, two-factor authentication can be deployed.
